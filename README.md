## About this Course

This course will introduce the learner to text mining and text manipulation basics. The course begins with an understanding of how text is handled by python, the structure of text both to the machine and to humans, and an overview of the nltk framework for manipulating text. The second week focuses on common manipulation needs, including regular expressions (searching for text), cleaning text, and preparing text for use by machine learning processes. The third week will apply basic natural language processing methods to text, and demonstrate how text classification is accomplished. The final week will explore more advanced methods for detecting the topics in documents and grouping them by similarity (topic modelling).

This course should be taken after: Introduction to Data Science in Python, Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, and Applied Machine Learning in Python.

## Syllabus

### Week 1

In Module One, you will be introduced to basic machine learning concepts, tasks, and workflow using an example classification problem based on the K-nearest neighbors method, and implemented using the scikit-learn library. This week’s assignment has you work through the process of loading and examining a dataset, training a k-nearest neighbors classifier on the dataset, and then evaluating the accuracy of the classifier and using it to classify new data.

### Week 2

In Module Two, you will delve into NLTK, a very popular toolkit for processing text in Python. Through NLTK, you will be introduced to common natural language processing tasks and how to extract semantic meaning from text. For this week’s assignment, you’ll get a hands-on experience with NLTK to process and derive meaningful features and statistics from text.

### Week 3

In Module Three, you will engage with two of the most standard text classification approaches, viz. naïve Bayes and support vector machine classification. Building on some of the topics you might have encountered in Course 3 of this specialization, you will learn about deriving features from text and using NLTK and scikit-learn toolkits for supervised text classification. You will also be introduced to another natural language challenge of analyzing sentiment from text reviews. For this week’s assignment, you will train a classifier to detect spam messages from non-spam (“ham”) messages. Through this assignment, you will also get a hands-on experience with cross-validation and training and testing phases of supervised classification tasks.

### Week 4

In Module Four, you will be introduced to more advanced text mining approaches of topic modeling and semantic text similarity. You will also explore advanced information extraction topics, such as named entity recognition, building on concepts you have seen through Module One and Module Three of this course. The final assignment lets you explore semantic similarity of text snippets and building topic models using the gensim package. You will also experience the practical challenge of making sense of topic models in real life.
